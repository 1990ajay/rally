This directory is used to patch existing openstack code

All patches are applied to appropriate projects to add needed functionality (e.g. profiling code)

git format-patch is used to create new patches

Since this patches will become outdated we have a test that makes sure that they can be applied to latest openstack repositories.
In case this test fails patches must be updated
